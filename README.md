# Homework Assignment 1
### Homework by - Lea Guerrero

Homework assignment 1 is a test of taking a document that had incorrect usage of html elements, structure, and attrubutes. The goal was to take each line and reconstuct the document to make a logical structure.  
## Items that I had edited: 
Removing the Div's and making them a header, section, article, or footer. 
Adding in each section an Alt="" after each image so if someone with a disablitly is trying to understand the image with a screen reader it has a brief discription of what is happening with in that image.
